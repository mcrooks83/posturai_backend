The output of the calculations should take into account that the image is fontal image
i.e facing the camera.  For example, if the right should is deemed closer to the camera then
the spine is rotated to the left. If the line between the hip mid point and the shoulder mid point
is left then the spine is actually flexed right.  

Knee flexion seems to move the landmark up the image

HEAD:

Frontal tilt -  inner eye angle
Roation      -  inner eye left to nose, inner eye right to nose (horizonal) - shorter distance is closer to camera

NECK:   

Frontal Tile -  angle between the mid hip point to shoulders and should mid point to nose.  0 would be line is straight. 
                clockwise the angle would be small on the right of the lines if the neck is flexed to the right and large if it
                were flexed to the left

Rotation     -  relatively opposite to the spine
                perhaps use the nose and distance to another landmark on each side to determine roation

SHOULDERS

Frontal Tilt -  angle between left and right shoulder landmark
                


SPINE

Lateral Flexion -   calcualtes the angle between the spine vector and the vertical reference vector

Rotation        -   uses the distance of the shoulder landmark to the hip mid point.  shorter distance is closer to camera
                    and thus rotated to the opposite side (i.e if right is shorter it is rotated to the left)

PELVIS          

Hike            -   uses angle between left and right hip landmark
                    could use y coordinate

Rotation        -   uses the hip positions (x axis) and the base midline to determine which is closer and thus
                    more rotated

KNEE            
                -   internal / external rotation calcualted from ankle, knee, hip x positions 
                    doesnt work out whether the knee is internally rotated or not but suggests one is more rotated than the other.
                    there could be extrenal rotation
                    perhaps the distance between hip and knee (x direction) can be used for aduction comparison
